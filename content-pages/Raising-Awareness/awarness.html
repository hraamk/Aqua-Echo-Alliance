            <p>
              Marine biodiversity refers to the variety of life in the ocean and
              coastal ecosystems. These diverse ecosystems are home to a wide range
              of species, from tiny plankton to magnificent whales, and play a
              crucial role in maintaining the health of our planet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Marine biodiversity provides essential services to humans, including
              food resources, climate regulation, coastal protection, and
              recreational opportunities. However, marine ecosystems are facing
              unprecedented threats from human activities, such as overfishing,
              habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change.

          <div id="pollutioncontent">
            <p>
              Pollution has become a significant environmental issue, posing serious
              threats to marine life, ecosystems, and human health. Every year,
              millions of tons of pollutants enter our oceans, contaminating
              waterways, shorelines, and remote habitats.
            </p>
            <p>
              Marine animals often mistake debris for food or become entangled in
              discarded items, leading to injury, suffocation, and death. Pollution
              also leaches harmful chemicals into the environment, threatening
              marine biodiversity and disrupting fragile ecosystems.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Aqua Echo Alliance, we are dedicated to tackling the plastic
              pollution crisis through awareness campaigns, community clean-up
              efforts, and innovative solutions. By promoting recycling, reducing
              plastic consumption, and advocating for policy changes, we aim to
              combat plastic pollution and safeguard the health of our oceans.
