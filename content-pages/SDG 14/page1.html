    <h2> What is SDG 14 - Life Below Water? </h2>
    <p>
      Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14) focuses on "Life Below Water," addressing the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas, and marine resources. With over 70% of the Earth's surface covered by oceans, these bodies of water play a crucial role in regulating the planet's climate, providing sustenance, and supporting diverse ecosystems. However, human activities such as overfishing, pollution, coastal development, and climate change have significantly threatened the health and biodiversity of marine environments.<br><br>

SDG 14 aims to promote the protection and restoration of marine ecosystems, including coral reefs, mangroves, and other vital habitats. It advocates for sustainable fisheries management practices to ensure the long-term viability of marine resources and the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on them. Additionally, the goal emphasizes the need to reduce marine pollution, including plastic waste, oil spills, and nutrient runoff, which pose severe threats to marine life and ecosystems.<br><br>

Through collaborative efforts involving governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector, progress towards SDG 14 involves implementing policies and practices that prioritize the sustainable use of marine resources while mitigating environmental degradation. This includes establishing marine protected areas, strengthening regulations on fishing practices, promoting sustainable aquaculture, investing in clean technologies, and raising awareness about the importance of preserving marine ecosystems for current and future generations. Achieving SDG 14 not only contributes to the conservation of biodiversity and the resilience of marine ecosystems but also supports broader sustainable development objectives, including poverty reduction, food security, and climate action.<br><br>
