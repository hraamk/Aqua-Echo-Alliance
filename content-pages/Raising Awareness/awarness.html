        <h2>Marine Biodiversity</h2>
        <p>Marine biodiversity refers to the variety of life in the ocean and coastal ecosystems. These diverse ecosystems are home to a wide range of species, from tiny plankton to magnificent whales, and play a crucial role in maintaining the health of our planet.</p>
        <p>Marine biodiversity provides essential services to humans, including food resources, climate regulation, coastal protection, and recreational opportunities. However, marine ecosystems are facing unprecedented threats from human activities, such as overfishing, habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change.</p>
        <p>At Aqua Echo Alliance, we are committed to protecting marine biodiversity and preserving the delicate balance of ocean ecosystems. Through research, education, and conservation initiatives, we strive to raise awareness about the importance of marine biodiversity and promote sustainable practices to ensure the health and resilience of our oceans for future generations.</p>

    <section id="plastic-pollution">
      <h2>Plastic Pollution</h2>
      <p>Plastic pollution has become a significant environmental issue, posing serious threats to marine life, ecosystems, and human health. Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste enter our oceans, contaminating waterways, shorelines, and remote habitats.</p>
      <p>Marine animals often mistake plastic debris for food or become entangled in discarded plastic items, leading to injury, suffocation, and death. Plastic pollution also leaches harmful chemicals into the environment, threatening marine biodiversity and disrupting fragile ecosystems.</p>
      <p>At Aqua Echo Alliance, we are dedicated to tackling the plastic pollution crisis through awareness campaigns, community clean-up efforts, and innovative solutions. By promoting recycling, reducing plastic consumption, and advocating for policy changes, we aim to combat plastic pollution and safeguard the health of our oceans.</p>
