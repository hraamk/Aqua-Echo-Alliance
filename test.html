        <p id="intro-content">SDG 14, or Sustainable Development Goal 14, is titled "Life Below Water." It is one of the seventeen goals established by the United Nations as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. SDG 14 focuses on conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. This goal aims to address various challenges faced by marine ecosystems, including marine pollution, overfishing, habitat destruction, and ocean acidification, among others. By promoting the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources, SDG 14 seeks to protect marine biodiversity, ensure the health and productivity of oceans, and support the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on marine ecosystems for food, income, and other resources. Achieving SDG 14 is crucial for the overall health of the planet and for securing the well-being of present and future generations.</p>
